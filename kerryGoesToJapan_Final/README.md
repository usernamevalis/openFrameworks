This is an app I made as a farewell gift

This is based on the ofBoxExample.

I have deleted the original images but to use you own simply add them to the data folder and name them 0,1,2,3,4....etc for example "0.jpg", "1.jpg".
Im specifically using Jpg's.
For the background image do the same but name the background image "background.png" - im using a .png but you can change 
this along with the box image file types in the code
You can change the audio track using the same process but working in the ounds directory
Add or remove blocks by changing blockAmount in the App.h file
